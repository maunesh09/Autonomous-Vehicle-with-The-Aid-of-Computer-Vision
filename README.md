# Autonomous-Vehicle-with-The-Aid-of-Computer-Vision

This was my Final Year Project. Maini aim of this project was to create such a vehicle which would go to Pont A to Point B autonomously inside the industry or household.

In this Raspberry Pi works as the master Device & Arduino Uno as a slave.

Raspberry Pi will do the Image Processing part. It will Identify the road and will send signals to arduino to controll L298N based on the results of Image processing.

It will try to keep the vehicle in the middle of the road of the industry. If any obstacles orsomeone comes in its path then it will wait for it to move out of the way and notify the user by some haptic feedbacks from buzzers.
